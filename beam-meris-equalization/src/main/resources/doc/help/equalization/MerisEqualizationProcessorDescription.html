<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<p>
    The MERIS Equalization tool can be invoked from the VISAT tools menu by selecting
    the <b>Equalization (MERIS)</b> command. In the command line it is
    available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code> which is located in the BEAM <code>bin</code>
    directory. Please type <code>gpt Equalize -h</code> for further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>Equalization (MERIS)</b> command from the VISAT tool menu pops up the
    following dialog:

<h4>I/O Parameter</h4>
<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b><br>
    Here the user specifies the name of the source product. The combo box presents
    a list of all products open in VISAT. The user may select one of these
    or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b><br>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b><br>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of output file formats currently supported by BEAM.
    The text field allows to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in VISAT:</b><br>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in VISAT. When the
    the target product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.
</p>

<h4>Processing Parameter</h4>

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/equalization-proc-parameters.png" alt="MERIS Equalization Dialog"/>
</p>

<h5>Parameter Panel</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Reprocessing version:</b><br>
    Specifies the version of the reprocessing the product comes from. Depending on version different LUTs are used.
    If set to AUTO_DETECT the processor tries to detect the reprocessing version. This is the default value.
    The equalization algorithm supports data from the 2nd or 3rd reprocessing.<br>
    The only difference lies in the LUTs used. Depending on the value of the field <i>software_ver</i> in
    the MPH of the MERIS product the appropriate LUT is chosen to retrieve the coefficients (if AUTO_DETECT is
    selected).<br>
    If the <i>software_ver</i> is between <b>MERIS/4.1</b> and <b>MERIS/5.06</b> or between
    <b>MEGS-PC/7.4</b> and <b>MEGS-PC/7.5</b> the product is considered to be from the 2nd reprocessing. <br>
    If the software_ver is above <b>MEGS-PC/8.0</b> the product is considered to be from the 3nd reprocessing.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Perform SMILE correction:</b><br>
    Specifies if the SMILE correction shall be performed or not. this option should be disabled, if the selected source
    product is already SMILE corrected or if a subsequent processing step does it.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Perform radiance-to-reflectance conversion:</b><br>
    Specifies if the input TOA radiance values shall be converted to TOA reflectances.
    If the conversion is omitted the result of the equalization processor can be used like a standard MERIS L1b
    product for further processing.
</p>


<h4>Button Group</h4>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run:</b><br>
    Creates the target product. The processing is actually deferred until its band data is accessed, either by
    writing the product to a file or by viewing the band data. If the <b>Save as</b> option is checked, the processing
    is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close:</b><br>
    Closes the dialog.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help:</b><br>
    Displays this page in VISAT Help.
