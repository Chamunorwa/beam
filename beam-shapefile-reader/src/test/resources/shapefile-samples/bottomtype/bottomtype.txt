  Description:
    Abstract: This data is a qualitatively-derived interpretative polygon shapefile defining the bottom types of the seafloor from Boston Harbor and the harbor approaches, Massachusetts. Approximately 170 km² of sidescan sonar and bathymetric data were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ship Whiting in 2000 and 2001 and reprocessed and gridded by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
    Purpose: The geophysical dataset were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) branch as part of their periodic hydrographic mapping for nautical charting. The raw datasets were provided by NOAA to the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Woods Hole, MA as part of a cooperative agreement to provide high resolution bathymetry and backscatter intensity maps and digital GIS information for resource management, scientific research, industry and the public.

      Source_Contribution: The original geophysical data for this project were collected during four hydrographic surveys conducted by NOAA NOS in 2000 and 2001 on the NOAA Ship Whiting and its launches 1005/1014.  Multibeam bathymetric data were acquired with a Reson SeaBat 8101 and sidescan sonar backscatter data were acquired with Edgetech model 272-T (100 kHz) or the Klein T-5500 (455 kHz) sonar systems.  The NOAA acquisition vessels were also equipped with Odom Echotrac DF3200 MKII echosounders that logged high-frequency (100 kHz) vertical-beam soundings concurrently throughout the sidescan sonar and multibeam bathymetry surveying operations.  Vertical-beam soundings were recorded in Hypack raw format and later converted to CARIS HDCS format.  The NOAA Office of Coast Survey cleaned and merged the data and performed tide corrections using CARIS HIPS.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The study area was separated into six units based on local bottom slope, backscatter intensity, surficial sediment texture and anthropogenic activity. These units were delineated qualitatively at a scale of 1:30,000 in areas where both new sidescan sonar and bathymetric data are available (about 155 km2, the source data sets were derived from the datasets described in the previous process step). A local bottom slope was calculated from the 30-m gridded bathymetry as the average slope between the central pixel and the surrounding 8 pixels. Areas smaller than about 200 meters were not delineated. The shapefile was created in ArcGIS 9.1 (ArcMap) by alternating the hillshade, slope and backscatter rasters overlay and manually drawing polygons for the regions representing the six classes of defined bottom type.
