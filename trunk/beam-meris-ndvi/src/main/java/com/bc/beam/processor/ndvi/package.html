The <code>{@link com.bc.beam.usage.ndvi}</code> package contains example code
for a simple MERIS ndvi processor. This file will give a detailed step by step instruction on
how to implement a scientific processor using the processor framework supplied by the
MERIS/AATSR Toolbox.
<p>
    The example processor is invoked with a single commad line argument - the path to a
    request file. See also <a HREF="#request_file_definition">Request File Definition</a>.
    An example processing request file <a HREF="./NdviProcReq.xml">NdviProcReq.xml</a> is located next to the
    source code files. You must modify the input product and output product paths according to your computers setup.

<p>
    Packages used in this example are:
    <LD>
        <LI>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.dataio Data I/O}</LI>
        <LI>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.processor Processor framework}</LI>
        <LI>{@link org.esa.beam.util Utility classes}</LI>
    </LD>

<h2>The ndvi processor main class - <code>@link org.esa.beam.examples.ndvi_processor.NdviProcessorMain
    NdviProcessorMain</code></h2>

This class implements the <code>main()</code> method of the processor to be able to invoke
the processor from the command line. It is a general convention that every executable within the
Toolbox project has a xxxMain.java file which contains the <code>main()</code> method. This
makes it easier to navigate the code.
<p>
    This class implements just one method, the <code>main()</code> method. Within main, the ndvi
    processor is created and the command line and the processor are passed to a <code>ProcessorRunner</code>.
    Additionally there is some code for exception handling, but basically this is everything that's happening in main.

<p>
    The <code>{@link ProcessorRunner}</code> takes the further control of what happens to the processor.
    It performs a lot of actions in the background which otherwise have to be programmed over and over
    for each processor. The runner performs the following steps:
<ul>
    <li>Parse the command line</li>
    <li>Load and parse the request file</li>
    <li>Switches debug mode on when the appropriate command line parameter is set</li>
    <li>Checks if the processor should run in interactive mode. If so
        <ul>
            <li>Initializes the processor with a request, if one is present</li>
            <li>Creates the processor UI frame and attaches the processor to it</li>
            <li>Attaches a progressbar to the processor and</li>
            <li>runs the processor ui frame</li>
        </ul>
        If the processor should run in non interactive mode it:
        <ul>
            <li>Loops over all requests in the request file and for each request it</li>
            <li>initializes the processor with the current request</li>
            <li>logs the processor header (optionally)</li>
            <li>logs the request and</li>
            <li>runs the processor on the current request</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
A special note should be take to the last paragraph: the processor runner can handle request files
containing any number of requests and lets the processor perform all calculations in batch mode.

<h2>The processor class - <code>{@link NdviProcessor}</code></h2>
This class contains all of the ndvi processor specific functionality. It inherits from the abstract
<code>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.processor.Processor}</code> class which is embedded in the processor framework.
<p>
    The only method that must be implemented by <code>NdviProcessor</code> is the <code>process</code> method. This
    is the "worker-method". It is invoked by the framework each time a request has to be processed.

<p>
    A first step in the process method is checking the request type. See the <code>checkRequestType</code> method.
    It can be seen how the base class functionality of the processor class is used to retrieve the
    request processed, which is at this point automatically read from the request file, parsed and
    (optionally) verified.

<p>
    The second thing to do is opening the input product denoted in the request. This happens in
    the <code>loadInputProduct</code> method. Here, the functionality of the ProductIO framework is used to
    read the input product skeleton (not the product data but metadata, product size, band names ...).
    The class <code>ProductIO</code> automatically creates an object of type <code>Product</code> that
    holds all this information. Note that <code>ProductIO</code> automatically decides which product type
    the requested product is and which <code>ProductReader</code> to use. Once the input product is read,
    the two bands needed for the ndvi calculation are requested from the product.

<p>
    Now the output product must be created. This happens in the <code>createOutputProduct</code> method. This method
    reads the product width and height from the input product. Then an output product is created which at
    this point is just an empty hull with a product type, product name and same dimensions as the input product.
    Then the resulting ndvi band is added. The product now neither contains data nor has a disk representation,
    it's pure virtual. Again, the <code>ProductIO</code> class supplies the product with an appropriate disk writer,
    the default one in this example. And finally, the disk represenation is written out.


<h2>The request file definition<a NAME="request_file_definition"></a></h2>
All processors using the processor framework are "request-driven". A request is a xml-file defining one
or more "processing requests". An example request file can be found in this examples directory.
<p>
    The request file must contain a few basic lines. These are:
<ul>
    <li>The xml header,</li>
    <li>a request list tag and</li>
    <li>a number of requests</li>
</ul>
All tags supported in a request file and understood by the request loader are defined in
<code>{@link org.esa.beam.framework.processor.RequestTags}</code>. You can define any number of named parameters
to customize processor requests.
<p>
    For future expansion, it is mandatory that every processor defines a request type, in this case
    the type is defined by "NDVI_EXAMPLE".

<p>
    Then this simple example request just defines two more entrie, the input product and the output product.
