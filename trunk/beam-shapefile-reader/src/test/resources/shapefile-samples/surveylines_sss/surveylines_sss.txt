  Description:
    Abstract: These data are the trackline from the high-resolution acoustic backscatter measurements of the seafloor from Boston Harbor and the harbor approaches, Massachusetts. Approximately 170 km² of sidescan sonar data were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ship Whiting in 2000 and 2001 and reprocessed by the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
    Purpose: These data were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) branch as part of their periodic hydrographic mapping for nautical charting.  The raw datasets were provided by NOAA to the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Woods Hole, MA as part of a cooperative agreement to provide high resolution bathymetry and backscatter intensity maps and digital GIS information for resource management, scientific research, industry and the public.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: All of the NOAA survey vessels were equipped with Trimble DSM212L Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) receivers.  Launch 1005, which collected all of the multibeam bathymetry, was also equipped with a TSS POS/MV Model 320 (Position and Orientation System for Marine Vessels).  Standard bathymetric processing, including tide corrections, soundings accuracy, and quality control were done by the NOAA Office of Coast Survey.

      Source_Contribution: The original geophysical data for this project were collected during four hydrographic surveys conducted by NOAA NOS in 2000 and 2001 on the NOAA Ship Whiting and its launches 1005/1014.  Multibeam bathymetric data were acquired with a Reson SeaBat 8101 and sidescan sonar backscatter data were acquired with Edgetech model 272-T (100 kHz) or the Klein T-5500 (455 kHz) sonar systems.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Sidescan data were acquired by NOAA NOS with the Edgetech model 272-T (100 kHz) or the Klein T-5500 (455 kHz) sidescan sonar systems. Equipment was either hull mounted or towed. Range, layback, gain and other acquisition parameters varied and were adjusted accordingly in the acquisition software.  Raw .xtf sonar files were transfered from NOAA NOS to the USGS/CZM.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The raw sidescan-sonar data were processed using XSonar/ShowImage software. The processing steps included demultiplexing the raw sidescan data using a median filtering routine to suppress speckle noise, a file check of navigation points to delete repeated fixes or other logging errors, correct for slant-range distortion, signal attenuation, and dropped sonar lines (Danforth, W.W., 1997, Xsonar/ShowImage: A complete system for rapid sidescan-sonar processing and display: U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report 97-686, 77 p.).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The navigation fixes were batch converted to a single text file of equal interval points along each survey line using the Linux shell script "convertXsonarNav" (which parses all of the .nav files created during Xsonar processing, reporjects the data to UTM zone 19 outputs easting, northing, julian date, linename to a new file.
