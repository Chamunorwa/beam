<h3>Map Projection</h3>

<p>
    The map projection command applies a selected <a href="../general/MapProjTable.html">Available Map Projections</a>
    to
    the selected product and creates a new transposed output product. If you want that
    <a href="Orthorectification.html">Orthorectification</a> is also applied to the new product use the
    <a href="OrthorectificationDialog.html">Orthorectification Tool</a>. If its your intention to create one product
    from
    multiple input products use the <a href="../processors/mosaic/MosaicTool.html">Mosaic Processor</a>.
</p>

<p>
    After the new product has been created, you can change to VISAT's
    <a href="ProductBrowser.html">product browser</a> in order to open
    an <a href="ProductSceneView.html">image view</a> for a band of the new product.
</p>


<p align="center"><img src="images/MapProjection.jpg"></p>

<h4>Input/Output</h4>
<h5>Input Product:</h5>

<p>Displays the name of the currently selected input product.</p>


<h5>Output Product:</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    You can specify the output product's name here. The name must be unique within VISAT's open product list.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Description:</b>
    A short description text for the new product can be entered here.</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Include Tie Point Grids:</b>
    If selcted the tie point grids of the input product are also projected and stored in the ouput product as bands.</p>

<h4>Projection</h4>
<h5>Collocate with Product:</h5>

<p>
    This check is only enabled if other map-projected products are already opened in VISAT and if this products
    have a spatial overlap with the currently selected product. If this option is enabled and checked you
    can select a product from which you want to transfer the map projection information to the output product.
    Collocation is extremly useful if you want to compare pixel values of different types of products, e.g. MERIS and
    AATSR,
    MERIS L1b and MERIS L2 products. For example, bands of collocated products can be used in a single
    mathematical expression in the <a href="BandArithmetics.html">Band Arithmetics Tool</a>.
</p>

<h5>Projection:</h5>

<p>You can select one of the supported map projections here.
    For a description of the available map-projections, please refer to the chapter <i><a
        href="../general/MapProjTable.html">Available
    Map Projections</a></i>.
    To identify a suitable UTM
    zone for your product scene, refer to the figures <a href="#utm1">UTM Zones
    1 to 30</a> and <a href="#utm2">UTM Zones 30 to 60</a>. The projection "UTM
    Automatic" automatically selects a suitable UTM zone based on the input
    product's center co-ordinate.</p>

<h5>Datum:</h5>

<p>Currently only the WGS-84 datum is supported.</p>

<h5>Projection Parameters Button</h5>

<p>
    If you select an adjustable projection, you are able to define the parameters for the projection.

<p align="center"><img src="images/MapProjectionProjectionParameters.jpg" width="286" height="226" border="0"></p>

<p>
</p>

<h5>Resampling Method:</h5>

<p>
    You can select one resampling method for the projection.
    For a brief description have a look at <a href="../general/ResamplingMethods.html">Resampling Methods</a>.
</p>


<h5>Output Parameters Button</h5>

<p>Clicking this button leads to the output parameters dialog which lets you specify the position of the <b>reference
    pixel</b>
    and the <b>easting</b> and <b>northing</b> at this pixel of the output product. Also you are able to set the
    <b>orientation angle</b> and the pixel size.
    The orientation angle is the angle between geographic north and map grid north (in degrees),
    with other words, the convergence angle of the projection's vertical axis from true north.
    Easting and northing and also the pixel size are given in the units of the underlying map
    (e.g. dec. degree for geographic and meter for the UTM projection).</p><br>

<p align="center"><img src="images/MapProjectionOutputParameters.jpg" width="295" height="450" border="0"></p>
<br>

<p>
    In order to force a certain width and height in pixels for the output product, you must deselect
    the <b>adjust size</b> option. Otherwise the size is automatically adjusted, so that the entire source
    region is included in the new region.
</p>

<p>
    The default <a href="NoDataValue.html">no-data value</a> is used for output pixels in the projected band which have
    either
    no corresponding pixel in the source product or the source pixel is invalid.
    This value is only used, if the corresponding source band does not use a <a href="NoDataValue.html">no-data
    value</a>, otherwise
    the no-data value of the source band is used.
</p>


<h4>Output Product Information</h4>

<p>Displays properties of the resulting output product.</p>


<h4>OK Button</h4>

<p>Applies the selected map projection to the selected product by creating a new product.
    You can now change to the <a href="ProductBrowser.html">product browser</a>
    in order to open an <a href="ProductSceneView.html">image view</a> for the map
    transformed band.
