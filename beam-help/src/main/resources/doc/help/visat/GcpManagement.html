<h4>GCP Management in VISAT</h4>

<p>
    A GCP is a marker for a certain geographical position within a geo-referenced image.
    The properties of a GCP are
<ul>
    <li>the geographical co-ordinate,</li>
    <li>a graphical symbol,</li>
    <li>the name (label),</li>
    <li>and a textual description.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In contrast to a pin a GCP is fixed to a geographical position while the pin is not.
    GCPs can be used to create a <a href="#gcpGeoCoding">GCP geo-coding</a> for a product or improve an existing
    geo-coding or define a new one.
</p>

<p>
    GCPs are displayed as symbols at their geographical positions in image views associated
    with the current product. GCPs are stored in the current product and available again if the
    product is re-opened.<br>

    New GCPs can be created with the <a href="#gcpTool">GCP tool</a>
    It is also possible to create and remove GCPs by using the <a href="#gcpManager">GCP manager</a>.


<h4><a name="gcpTool">The GCP Tool &nbsp;&nbsp;</a><img src="images/icons/GcpTool24.gif"></h4>

<p>
    The GCP tool is used to create a new GCP but and also to select an existing GCP.
    If the GCP tool is active, a click into an image view creates a new GCP at the
    current cursor position. If you click on an existing GCP is becomes the selected GCP.
    If you double-click on an existing GCP the <a href="#editGcpDialog">Edit GCP</a> dialog appears
    and lets you the edit the properties of the selected GCP.


<h4><a name="gcpManager">The GCP Manager &nbsp;&nbsp;</a><img src="images/icons/GcpManager24.gif"></h4>

<p>
    The GCP manager is used to display all GCPs stored in the current product within a
    table and provides some GCP related operations.

<p align="center"><img src="images/GcpManager.png"></p>

<p>
    If you click on a GCP within the table it becomes the selected GCP.
    Double-clicking on GCP in the table opens the <a href="#editGcpDialog">Edit GCP</a>.
    You can also change the values for <code>X, Y , Lat and Lon</code> of the GCP, by editing the table cells directly. 
</p>

<p>In the following the tool buttons of the GCP manager are explained.</p>

<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/icons/New24.gif"></td>

        <td>Exports all values of the displayed table to a flat text
            file.
            The exported text is tabulator-separated and may therefore be import directly into a spreadsheet application
            (e.g. MS Excel).

<h4><a name="editGcpDialog">The Edit GCP Dialog</a></h4>

<p>
    The GCP edit dialog is used to edit the properties of a GCP after a new GCP has been created or after a
    selected GCP has been double-clicked. This dialog is also available in the GCP manager.

<p align="center"><img src="images/GcpEditor.png"></p>

<p>The editable GCP properties are
<ul>
    <li>the geographical co-ordinate, which can also been given as pixel position</li>
    <li>the name for the GCP</li>
    <li>and a textual description.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="gcpGeoCoding">GCP Geo-Coding</a></h4>
<p>
    This geo-coding calculated by using the defined GCPs as reference points and the given polynomial method type.
    You can choose between the <code>linea, quadratic or a qubic</code> polynopmial method.
    The <code>status</code> field below the ploynomial method chooser shows you if you already have enough GCPs
    defined for the currently choosen method or if the geo-coding is already attached to the product.<br>
    On the lower left hand side information about the currently attache GCP geo-coding is displayed.
    It shows the used polynomial method and the overall <code>RMSE</code> for the latitudes and longitudes.
    In the table you can see the deviation (<code>Delta Lat</code> and <code>Delta Lon</code>) for each GCP from the
    given to the calculated geo-position.
    If you attach a GCP geo-coding to the product the former geo-coding is preserved and restored if you detache
    the GCP geo-coding.
