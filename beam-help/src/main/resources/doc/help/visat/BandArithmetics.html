<h3>Band Arithmetic</h3>

<p>The band arithmetic tool is used to create new image sample values derived
    from existing bands, tie-point grids and flags. The source data can originate
    from all currently open and spatially compatible input products. The source
    data is combined by an arithmetic expression to generate the target data. By
    default, a new image view is automatically opened for the new sample values.
    You can disable this behaviour in the preferences dialog.</p>

<p>Please refer to the
    <a href="ExpressionEditor.html">expression editor</a> documentation for the syntax and capablities of
    expressions.</p>

<p>After the new band has been created (or an existing has been overwritten), you can change to VISAT's
    <a href="ProductBrowser.html">product browser</a> in order to open an image view in
    order to inspect the resulting samples.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/BandArithmetic.jpg" width="473" height="381"></p>

<h4><span class="i1"><a name="targetProduct"></a></span>Target Product:</h4>

<p>Select the target product for the band which will hold the resulting samples.</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use new Product</b> checkbox<br>
    Check here, whether to create a new product for a new band or to use an existing product in order to overwrite an
    existing band.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>New...</b> button<br>
    Opens the "new product" dialog, which lets you specify the new product's name and description as
    well as it's parent (base) product.
</p>

<h4>Target Band:</h4>

<p>Select the target band which will hold the resulting samples.</p>

<p class="i1">
    <a name="virtualBands"></a>
    <b>Create virtual Band</b> checkbox<br>
    If checked, a new <i>virtual band</i> is created instead of a normal band. In opposite to a real band,
    the pixel data of a virtual band is <b>not</b> stored in a product and therefore the product requires less memory
    when stored to disk. A virtual band always uses its mathematical band expression to re-create it's pixel values at
    any
    time the data is requested.<br>
    The expression of a virtual band can be edited by opening the context menu over a selected virtual band (right-click
    mouse)
    in the product browser. Select <b>Edit virtual band expression</b> and modify the expression.
</p>

<p class="inote">
    <b>Note:</b> If you create a virtual band, it is not possible to use the data sources of multiple products within
    the same expression.
    All data sources within an expression of a virtual band must originate from the parent product of the virtual band.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use new Band</b> checkbox<br>
    Check here, whether to create a new band or to overwrite an existing band of an existing product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>New...</b> button<br>
    Opens the "new band" dialog, which lets you specify the new band's name and description.
</p>

<h4>Expression:</h4>

<p> This field takes the arithmetic expression which is used to create new data
    samples. Please refer to the <a href="ExpressionEditor.html">expression editor</a>
    documentation for the syntax and capabilities of expressions. </p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Edit Expression...</b> button<br>
    Opens the <a href="ExpressionEditor.html">expression editor</a> which provides a
    a convenient way to create valid arithmetic expressions.
</p>

<h4>Exception Handling:</h4>

<p>
    When arbitrary expressions are evaluated it can naturally happen that some kind
    of numeric exceptions like <i>division by zero</i> occur. The options here are
    provided to handle such situations.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Warn, if any arithmetic exception is detected.</b> checkbox <br>
    If checked, a dialog box is displayed after processing when arithmetic exceptions
    have been detected. </p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>No-data value to be used on arithmetic exceptions:</b> checkbox<br>
    If checked, the given <a href="NoDataValue.html">no-data value</a> is used as pixel value
    at pixel positions where a arithmetic exception has been detected (e.g. division by zero).
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>No-data value to be used on arithmetic exceptions:</b> edit field<br>
    The <a href="NoDataValue.html">no-data value</a>.
</p>

<h4>OK Button</h4>

<p>
    Computes the new sample data and closes the dialog. Refer to the preferences dialog for an option to
    specify whether or not to automatically open an image view for the new data samples.
