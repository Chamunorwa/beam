<h3>Import MODIS Product</h3>

<h4>BEAM Implementation of the MODIS Product Reader</h4>

<p>BEAM supports a subset of the products available of the NASA sensor MODIS,
    both on the Aqua and Terra platform. These products can be imported into VISAT, used as input products in the
    scientific data processors (where applicable) and accessed by Java developers using the Java product I/O framework.
</p>

<p>Due to the size of the MODIS products, especially in 250 m resolution, it is strongly recommended to work with
    these products using a spatial subset.
</p>

<h4>Supported MODIS Data Products</h4>

<p>The following MODIS data product types are supported by BEAM:

            SST4.</td></tr>

<h4>Geolocation of MODIS Products</h4>

<p>Due to the operational mode of the MODIS sensor, all MODIS products available
    from NASA experience "overlapping" scan lines. This is the so called "bow-tie" effect.
    These artifacts will be automatically removed by map-projecting the MODIS products.
</p>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/MODISBowTieEffect.jpg" width="292" height="250" border=0> 
</p>

<p class="inote">
    Since BEAM 3.5 this issue is solved by a special geo-coding.
    So these artifacts do not occure any more even in not map-projected MODIS products.
</p>


<h4>MODIS Level 2 Products</h4>

<p>The supported MODIS Level 2 products do not contain geo-location information. Instead, this
    information is stored in an accompagnying quality control file (<code>MxDOCQC</code>). The BEAM software tries
    to locate this file in the same directory as the Level 2 product resides. If the geo-location file is not
    present, the Level 2 product will be opened as raw datasets without geo-coding.
</p>

<h4>MODIS Quality Flags</h4>

<p>The current version of BEAM does not support flag coding of MODIS products and therefore bitmask overlays
    are currently not possible.
